# API-project

Create an API to develop new conversations and analyse their sentiment.

1. Create MongoDB Database structure with two collections: Users and Conversations. 

2. Create an API on the port 8800 with flask.

3. Clean Simpsons DataFrame to get a sample of conversations.

4. Create different functions to add info in MongoDB database through API: create user, create chat, add user to chat and add message to chat.

5. Create functions to get info from Simpson MongoDB database: get messages from chat, analyze sentiment from chat, analyze character sentiment and recommend character to a given character based on its conversations.
